Donatrix is a web page that promotes the reuse of food, clothing, and toys so that leftovers are not wasted and do not pollute the environment. The main objective is for large companies to publish their leftovers on this page so that civic associations or aid organizations can request them for free or at a very low price and pick them up at the address specified by the companies.

There are two different account types: a donor account (for companies) and a receiver account (for organizations). The donor registers the products they can offer along with their address, while the receiver can view these products by category, request them, and, if successful, receive a confirmation email.

The languages and technologies used for the backend are PHP and MySQL, and for the frontend, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
